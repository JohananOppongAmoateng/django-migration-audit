# django-migration-audit

**A forensic Django tool that verifies whether a live database schema is historically consistent with its applied migrations.**

> This project is under active development and not yet ready for production use. The core functionality is being implemented and tested, but the API may change and some features are still being refined. Use at your own risk and expect breaking changes.


## Why This Tool Exists

Django assumes: **if a migration is recorded as applied, the schema must match.**

Reality: **That assumption can be false.**

Common scenarios where this breaks:
- Modified migration files after application
- Manual database schema changes
- Fake-applied migrations (`--fake`)
- Squashed migrations with mismatches
- Database restores from backups
- Schema drift over time

This tool verifies both assumptions:
- **Reachability**: Can we trust the migration history?
- **Consistency**: Does the actual schema match what the history claims?

## Installation

```bash
pip install django-migration-audit
```

Or install from source:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/django-migration-audit.git
cd django-migration-audit
pip install -e .
```

Add to your Django project's `INSTALLED_APPS`:

```python
INSTALLED_APPS = [
    # ... other apps
    'django_migration_audit',
]
```

## Quick Start

### Basic Usage

```bash
# Run full audit (both comparisons)
python manage.py audit_migrations

# Audit specific database
python manage.py audit_migrations --database=replica

# Run only trust verification (Comparison A)
python manage.py audit_migrations --comparison=a

# Run only reality check (Comparison B)
python manage.py audit_migrations --comparison=b
```

### Example Output (Clean State)

```
=== Django Migration Audit ===
Database: default

Loading migration history and code...
  Applied migrations: 15
  Migration files on disk: 15
  Missing files: 0
  Squashed replacements: 0

🔍 Comparison A: Trust Verification
   (Migration history ↔ Migration code)

  Checking: No Missing Migration Files...
    ✅ Pass
  Checking: Squash Migrations Properly Replaced...
    ✅ Pass

🔍 Comparison B: Reality Check
   (Expected schema ↔ Actual schema)

  Building expected schema from migrations...
  Introspecting actual database schema...
    Expected tables: 8
    Actual tables: 8

  Checking: All Expected Tables Exist...
    ✅ Pass
  Checking: No Unexpected Tables...
    ✅ Pass
  Checking: All Expected Columns Exist...
    ✅ Pass

=== Summary ===
✅ No violations found! Migration state is consistent.
```

### Example Output (Issues Detected)

```
=== Django Migration Audit ===
Database: default

🔍 Comparison A: Trust Verification
  Checking: No Missing Migration Files...
    ❌ 1 violation(s)

🔍 Comparison B: Reality Check
  Checking: All Expected Tables Exist...
    ❌ 2 violation(s)
  Checking: No Unexpected Tables...
    ❌ 1 violation(s)

=== Summary ===
❌ Found 4 violation(s):
   Errors: 3
   Warnings: 1

  [ERROR] No Missing Migration Files: Migration myapp.0003_add_email is recorded as applied but file is missing
  [ERROR] All Expected Tables Exist: Expected table 'myapp_profile' does not exist in database
  [ERROR] All Expected Columns Exist: Expected column 'myapp_user.email' does not exist
  [WARNING] No Unexpected Tables: Unexpected table 'legacy_data' exists in database
```

## Architecture Overview

### The Three Inputs

1. **Migration History** (`django_migrations` table)
   - What Django thinks happened
   - Which migrations are recorded as applied, and in what order
   - No schema details—just names and app labels

2. **Migration Code** (migration files on disk: `migrations/*.py`)
   - What the project currently says should happen
   - The operations that were supposed to run
   - Detects: edited migrations, squashed migrations, rewritten history

3. **Live Database Schema** (database introspection)
   - What actually exists right now
   - Ground truth: tables, columns, indexes, constraints
   - The reality that everything else must match

### The Two Comparisons

```
(1) Migration history
        │
        │  🔍 Comparison A: Trust Verification
        ▼
(2) Migration code
        │
        │  produces expected schema
        ▼
    Expected schema
        │
        │  🔍 Comparison B: Reality Check
        ▼
(3) Live database schema
```

#### 🔍 Comparison A: Trust Verification
**Migration history ↔ Migration code**

**Detects:**
- Modified migration files
- Missing migration files
- Fake-applied migrations
- Squash mismatches

**Answers:** *"Can we trust the migration history at all?"*

#### 🔍 Comparison B: Reality Check
**Expected schema ↔ Actual schema**

**Detects:**
- Schema drift
- Manual database edits
- Broken legacy assumptions
- Missing/extra tables
- Column type mismatches
